Code adapted from this project: https://teamtreehouse.com/library/project-overview-8

To the best of my current ability I optimized data structures and abstracted helper functions out of the app.py file to ease code readability.

Having a solid foundation ("legacy code") to work with I instead focused on making improvements and writing more pythonic code.
